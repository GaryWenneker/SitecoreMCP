# ✅ GraphQL Works! - Working Configuration

## 🎉 SUCCESS!

GraphQL is **available and working** on your Sitecore instance!

### ✅ Working Configuration:
- **Endpoint:** `/sitecore/api/graph/edge`
- **API Key:** `{YOUR-API-KEY}`
- **Header:** `sc_apikey`

## 📝 Working Queries

### ✅ Get Item (Works!)
```graphql
{
  item(path: "/sitecore/content", language: "en") {
    id
    name
    displayName
    path
    template {
      id
      name
    }
    hasChildren
  }
}
```

**Result:**
- ID: `0DE95AE441AB4D019EB067441B7C2450`
- Name: `content`
- Path: `/sitecore/content`
- Template: `Main section`
- Has Children: `True`

### ✅ Query with Variables (Works!)
```graphql
query GetItem($path: String!) {
  item(path: $path, language: "en") {
    id
    name
    displayName
    path
  }
}
```

## ⚠️ Schema Differences

Some queries don't work because this GraphQL schema is different:
- ❌ `children` - Not available on `item`
- ❌ `fields` array - Not available
- ❌ `search` - Possibly different syntax

## 🔍 Next Steps

1. ✅ Open GraphQL IDE in browser: `https://your-sitecore-instance.com/sitecore/api/graph/edge/ui`
2. 🔍 View the complete schema with introspection
3. 📝 Adjust MCP server queries for this specific schema
4. ✨ Test and use!

## 🚀 MCP Server Status

The code is ready and GraphQL works! We just need to:
1. Adjust queries to the available schema
2. Find alternative ways for `children` and `fields`
3. Check search query syntax

**GraphQL is the right choice! 🎉**
