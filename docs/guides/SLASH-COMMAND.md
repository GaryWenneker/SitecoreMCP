# Slash Command Support - /sitecore

**Feature:** MCP Prompt Integration  
**Status:** ✅ Implemented  
**Version:** 1.2.0  
**Date:** October 16, 2025

---

## 🎯 What Is This?

When you type `/` in your chat interface (Claude Desktop, VS Code Copilot, etc.), you'll now see **`/sitecore`** in the slash command menu!

---

## 🚀 How It Works

### 1. Type `/` in Chat

You'll see a menu with available commands including:

```
/sitecore - 🔧 Sitecore command interface
```

### 2. Select `/sitecore`

The interface will prompt you for a command.

### 3. Type Your Command

```
get item /sitecore/content/Home
search articles
help
```

### 4. Get Results

Beautifully formatted response with all item details!

---

## 📋 Implementation Details

### MCP Prompts Capability

We added `prompts` capability to the MCP server:

```typescript
capabilities: {
  tools: {},
  prompts: {},  // ← NEW!
}
```

### Prompt Definition

```typescript
{
  name: "sitecore",
  description: "🔧 Sitecore command interface",
  arguments: [
    {
      name: "command",
      description: "Your Sitecore command",
      required: false
    }
  ]
}
```

### Prompt Handler

When you select `/sitecore`, it:
1. Takes your command input
2. Wraps it in `/sitecore [command]`
3. Passes to the `sitecore_command` tool
4. Returns formatted results

---

## 🎨 User Experience

### Before (without slash command)
```
User: "Can you get me the Home item from Sitecore?"
AI: *thinks* *calls tool* *formats response*
```

### After (with slash command)
```
User: / [menu appears]
User: Selects /sitecore
User: Types "get item /sitecore/content/Home"
AI: *instantly processes* *returns formatted result*
```

**Much faster and more intuitive!**

---

## 📈 Supported Commands

All natural language commands work:

### Quick Access
```
/sitecore → get item /sitecore/content/Home
/sitecore → search articles
/sitecore → children of /sitecore/content
```

### Full Syntax
```
