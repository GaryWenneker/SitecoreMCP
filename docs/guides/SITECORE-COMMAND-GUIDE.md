## 🧠 Pattern Matching

The command parser understands **15+ different patterns**:

### Flexible Syntax

| You Type | Parser Understands |
|----------|-------------------|
| `get item /path` | Get item |
| `get /path` | Get item (short) |
| `/path` | Get item (shortest!) |
| `get /path version 2` | Get specific version |
| `search keyword` | Simple search |
| `search for "keyword"` | Search with quotes |
| `search keyword in /path` | Scoped search |
| `find items with template X` | Template filter |
| `children of /path` | Get children |
| `children /path` | Get children (short) |
| `field Name from /path` | Get field value |

### Case Insensitive

All commands are case-insensitive:

```
/sitecore GET ITEM /sitecore/content/Home
/sitecore Search Articles
/sitecore CHILDREN OF /sitecore/content
```

All work the same!

---

## 🔧 Advanced Features

### Auto-Prefix Removal

The parser automatically removes `/sitecore` prefix:

```
/sitecore get item /path    → parses as "get item /path"
get item /path              → parses as "get item /path"
```

Works both ways!

### Smart Parameter Extraction

The parser intelligently extracts parameters:

```
/sitecore create item MyItem with template {GUID} under /parent
                      ^^^^^^              ^^^^^^^        ^^^^^^^
                      name                template       parent
```

### Error Recovery

When a command fails, you get:
- Clear error message
- What went wrong
- What to try instead
- Relevant suggestions

## 🎯 Best Practices

### 1. Use Short Syntax

```
✅ /sitecore /sitecore/content/Home
❌ /sitecore get item /sitecore/content/Home
```

Faster to type!

### 2. Use Quotes for Multi-Word Searches

```
✅ /sitecore search for "home page"
❌ /sitecore search home page    (searches for "page")
```

### 3. Start Broad, Then Narrow

```
# 1. Search everywhere
/sitecore search articles

# 2. Then search in specific path
/sitecore search articles in /sitecore/content/News

# 3. Then filter by template
/sitecore find items with template Article
```

### 4. Use Help When Unsure

```
/sitecore help       # All commands
/sitecore examples   # Categorized examples
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Command Not Recognized

**Symptom:** "Unknown command" message

**Solutions:**
1. Check `/sitecore help` for correct syntax
2. Try `/sitecore examples` for working examples
3. Make sure path starts with `/sitecore`

### No Results

**Symptom:** Search returns 0 items

**Solutions:**
1. Try broader search term
2. Remove path restriction
3. Check item exists in database
4. Verify language setting

### Permission Denied

**Symptom:** "AccessDeniedException" on mutations

**Solutions:**
1. Verify API key has write permissions
2. Check Sitecore security settings
3. Ensure user is in correct role (Author/Developer)
4. Test with read-only commands first

/sitecore /sitecore/content/Home version 2
/sitecore /sitecore/content/Home version 3
```

Compare versions easily!

### Tip 3: Template Discovery

```
/sitecore templates
```

See all available templates before creating items.

### Tip 4: Contextual Search

Search within specific content areas.

### Tip 5: Field Inspector

```
/sitecore field __Created from /sitecore/content/Home
/sitecore field __Updated from /sitecore/content/Home
/sitecore field __Owner from /sitecore/content/Home
```

Inspect system fields!
